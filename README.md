# *Employee Database Challenge*

## *Overview of the analysis:* 

  Our manager at Pewlett Hackard would like us to analyze the company's 
  data on employees further. Using the data, we will find the eligible employees 
  for retirement and list the total number of eligible retirees for each 
  position. Next, we will create a table that contains the second wave of 
  eligible retirees. The tables we make will help the company prepare for big 
  waves of retirees by knowing which positions will be vacant and determine which 
  employees we can contact to create a mentorship program that will allow 
  soon-to-be retirees to train new employees. 


### *Results:* Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
####    Work in progress



### *Summary:* Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

####    1. The "silver tsunami" will result in 72,458 position vacancies. 

####    2. There are 1549 eligible retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. That is not enough.
    
####    Suggestion one: The amount of employees in the company might mean that there are employees in many places of the world. It would be interesting to look at eligible retirees by country, state, and/or city.

####    Suggestion two: Creating a table for each department will show which ones are in more need of employees. Further conversation with each department manager will provide insight into if the exact number of vacant positions need to be filled or if some can be removed.
