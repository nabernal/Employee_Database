# *Employee Database Challenge*

## *Overview of the analysis:* 

  Our manager at Pewlett Hackard would like us to analyze the company's 
  data on employees further. Using the data, we will find the eligible employees 
  for retirement and list the total number of eligible retirees for each 
  position. Next, we will create a table that contains the second wave of 
  eligible retirees. The tables we make will help the company prepare for big 
  waves of retirees by knowing which positions will be vacant and determine which 
  employees we can contact to create a mentorship program that will allow 
  soon-to-be retirees to train new employees. 


### *Results:*

#### - The Senior Engineering and Senior Staff positions make up more than half of the employees that will soon be eligible for retirement.

#### - The Senior Engineer title has the highest amount of eligible retirees.

#### - Two managers positions will soon be vacant. 

#### -  When we compared the number of possible mentors to the number of positions that will soon be vacant, we noticed that the vacant positions exceed the number of mentors. 

### *Summary:*

####    1. The "silver tsunami" will result in 72,458 position vacancies. 50,842 will be senior positions, and the remaining 21,616 will be Engineering, staff, technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, and manager positions. 

####    2. There are 1549 eligible employees in the company that could serve as mentors to new Pewlett Hackard employees. The number of mentors compared to the number of soon-to-be vacant positions is very low. Other avenues should be explored to ensure new hires receive quality training. 
    
####    *Suggestion One:* The number of employees in the company might mean that there are employees in many places in the world. Therefore, it might benefit the company to look at eligible retirees by geographical location and timezone. 

####    *Suggestion Two:* Creating a table for each department will show which ones are in more need of employees. Further conversation with each department manager would be needed to determine if they can do without some positions.
